## MA 415 Final Project: Arson Data

For my final project, I have chosen to focus on the arson data within the National Fire Incident Reporting System data that we were given by Diane. Diane mentioned that she had noticed a change in the data from the state of Massachusetts in the year 2011, and she asked that we look at the national data to see if we could find anything interesting. I have chosen to look at the national arson data from the years 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2015 (two years before 2011, two years after 2011).

dt

# graph the number of arson events each year
gg <- ggplot(dt, aes(x=Year, y=`Number of Arson Incidents`)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + ggtitle("Number of Arson Incidents")
gg
```
  I am also interested in what it would look like to map this data set and figure out what states had the largest number of incidents of arson, so I am going to map the data from 2007.

```{r mapping w/o producing map, echo = FALSE, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# map the number of arson incidents by state in 2007
state_incident_table <- as.data.table(table(data_2007$STATE))
state_latlon_table <- as.data.table(state_incident_table$V1)
state_latlons <- apply(state_latlon_table, 2, geocode)
state_ll <- as.data.table(state_latlons)
state_ll$STATE <- state_latlon_table$V1
myMap <- get_map(location = "Montana", zoom = 3, maptype = "roadmap")
```
```{r map, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggmap(myMap) + geom_point(aes(x = state_ll$V1.lon, y = state_ll$V1.lat), data = state_incident_table, alpha = .5, color = "darkred", size = ((state_incident_table$N)/1000))
```

Based on this map, in 2007, California, Florida, and Washington had the greatest number of incidents of arson.

After an intitial exploration of the data, I narrowed my investigation to just a few specific variables that I found particularly interesting: civilian deaths, race and age of person arrested for committing arson, incendiary devices, and time of year of incidents. First I am going to look at civilian deaths.

```{r civilian deaths, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# let's look at how many civilian casualties there were per arson incident each year
death <- table(casualties$INC_NO)
d = as.data.table(death)
colnames(d) <- c("INC_NO", "Civilian Casualties")
data_2007 <- left_join(data_2007, d, by="INC_NO")

death10 <- table(casualties10$INC_NO)
d10 = as.data.table(death10)
colnames(d10) <- c("INC_NO", "Civilian Casualties")
data_2010 <- left_join(data_2010, d10, by="INC_NO")

death13 <- table(civiliancasualties13$INC_NO)
d13 = as.data.table(death13)
colnames(d13) <- c("INC_NO", "Civilian Casualties")
data_2013 <- left_join(data_2013, d13, by="INC_NO")

death15 <- table(civiliancasualties15$INC_NO)
d15 = as.data.table(death15)
colnames(d15) <- c("INC_NO", "Civilian Casualties")
data_2015 <- left_join(data_2015, d15, by="INC_NO")

# what does the spread of the civilian casualties data look like?
summary(data_2007$`Civilian Casualties`)
summary(data_2010$`Civilian Casualties`)
summary(data_2013$`Civilian Casualties`)
summary(data_2015$`Civilian Casualties`)

# Making a table of the mean number of civilian deaths per arson incident (in which at least one person died) per year
c <- c(3.1, 2.61, 2.444, 2.392)
deathmeans <- data.table(a, c)
colnames(deathmeans)[1] <- "Year"
colnames(deathmeans)[2] <- "Mean Number of Civilian Deaths Per Incident"
deathmeans

# plotting the mean number of civilian deaths per arson incident (in which at least one civilian died) per year
deathaverages <- ggplot(deathmeans, aes(x = Year, y = `Mean Number of Civilian Deaths Per Incident`)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + ggtitle("Number of Civilian Deaths Per Incident")
deathaverages

# is the number of civilian deaths per arson incident in which at least one person died in 2007 really different from the number of civilian deaths per arson incident in which at least one person died in 2015
t.test(data_2007$`Civilian Casualties`, data_2015$`Civilian Casualties`)
```

Clearly, as seen in the "Number of Civilian Deaths" graph and as proven in the two-sample hypothesis test, the number of civilian deaths due to arson incidents has significantly decreased from 2007 to 2015. Now I want to look more into the race and age of the person who committed arson. I am going to look at race in this PDF document, and age in the Shiny app.

```{r arsonists plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# loading race information about person who committed arson
RaceTable <- code_lookup[(code_lookup$FIELDID == "RACE"),]
RaceTable <- select(RaceTable, CODE_VALUE, CODE_DESCR)
RaceTable = RaceTable[-1,]
colnames(RaceTable) <- c("RACE", "Value")

# changing the observations from code into English
juv_sub <- left_join(juv_sub, RaceTable, by="RACE")
juv_sub %<>% select(-`RACE`)
colnames(juv_sub)[21] = "RACE"

# plotting the number of people of different races who were arrested for committing arson
c <- as.data.table(table(juv_sub$RACE))
Race <- c("White", "Black", "Other", "Unknown", "American Indian", "Asian")
Frequency <- c(801, 328, 128, 59, 12, 8)
race_table <- data.table(Race, Frequency)
ggplot(race_table, aes(Race, Frequency)) + geom_point(aes(size=Frequency))

# repeat fo 2010
juv_sub10 <- left_join(juv_sub10, RaceTable, by="RACE")
juv_sub10 %<>% select(-`RACE`)
colnames(juv_sub10)[21] = "RACE"
d <- as.data.table(table(juv_sub10$RACE))
Race10 <- c("White", "Black", "Other", "Unknown", "American Indian", "Asian")
Frequency10 <- c(801, 338, 117, 32, 25, 3)
race_table10 <- data.table(Race10, Frequency10)
ggplot(race_table10, aes(Race10, Frequency10)) + geom_point(aes(size=Frequency10))

# repeat for 2013
juv_sub13 <- left_join(juv_sub13, RaceTable, by="RACE")
juv_sub13 %<>% select(-`RACE`)
colnames(juv_sub13)[21] = "RACE"
a <- as.data.table(table(juv_sub13$RACE))
Race13 <- c("White", "Black", "Other", "Unknown", "American Indian", "Asian")
Frequency13 <- c(608, 289, 82, 41, 27, 6)
race_table13 <- data.table(Race13, Frequency13)
ggplot(race_table13, aes(Race13, Frequency13)) + geom_point(aes(size=Frequency13))

# repeat for 2015
juv_sub15 <- left_join(juv_sub15, RaceTable, by="RACE")
juv_sub15 %<>% select(-`RACE`)
colnames(juv_sub15)[21] = "RACE"
b <- as.data.table(table(juv_sub15$RACE))
Race15 <- c("White", "Black", "Other", "Unknown", "American Indian", "Asian")
Frequency15 <- c(486, 282, 59, 38, 22, 8)
race_table15 <- data.table(Race15, Frequency15)
ggplot(race_table15, aes(Race15, Frequency15)) + geom_point(aes(size=Frequency15))

```

From all of this information, it is clear that white people were much more likely to commit arson. In all four years that I investigated, many more white people committed arson than any other demographic, so this is likely a trend that continues today. Next I want to look at all of the incendiary devices that were used over the course of all four years.

```{r incendiary devices, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```
Clearly, the most popular forms of fuel are ordinary combustibles (which likely includes fuel that is meant to start controlled fires) and ignitable liquid. The most popular ignition devices are open flames, wicks and cigarettes and the most common containers that arsonists use are gasoline containers and plastic bottles. I had hoped that by further investigating this variable, I would be able to give suggestions for what products store owners could watch out for people buying in large quantities, because it could indicate that they were going to commit arson. Unfortunately, these are all pretty normal products, so they would be very difficult to regulate.

Now I am going to look into whether or not there are certain peak times of year that more civilians die due to incidents of arson. 

```{r time series, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# change all the dates to an easier format to work with
data_2007$INC_DATE <- mdy(data_2007$INC_DATE)
data_2010$INC_DATE <- mdy(data_2010$INC_DATE)
data_2013$INC_DATE <- mdy(data_2013$INC_DATE)
data_2015$INC_DATE <- mdy(data_2015$INC_DATE)
# Plot civilian casualties against date for each year
ggplot(data_2007, aes(INC_DATE, `Civilian Casualties`)) + geom_point(na.rm=TRUE) + ggtitle("Civilian Casualties Against Date, 2007")
ggplot(data_2010, aes(INC_DATE, `Civilian Casualties`)) + geom_point(na.rm=TRUE) + ggtitle("Civilian Casualties Against Time, 2010")
ggplot(data_2013, aes(INC_DATE, `Civilian Casualties`)) + geom_point(na.rm=TRUE) + ggtitle("Civilian Casualties Against Time, 2013")
ggplot(data_2015, aes(INC_DATE, `Civilian Casualties`)) + geom_point(na.rm=TRUE) + ggtitle("Civilian Casualties Against Time, 2015")


```

While the number of civilian casualties due to incidents of arson do seem to remain mostly constant throughout the year in all four years, there appears to be a slight decreasing trend throughout the year- there are generally more civilian casualties in January/February than in November/December. What I find really interesting about these plots is that in the 2015 plot, there are two outstanding observations in which over 150 civilians died. I want to look into this.

After further attemptng to research these two incidents of arson, I could not find any news reporting of these on the internet. I find this very strange, because I could find other reports of incidents of arson that resulted in much fewer deaths at other times of the year. This leads me to believe that the number of civilian casualties has been misrecorded here, which is kind of concerning.
